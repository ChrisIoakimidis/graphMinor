# graphMinor
This is my implementation of the graph minor alorithm for the 1st assignment of the Parallel and Distributed Systems class.
## For the project to run:
Inside the "myMatrix.h" file the paths to the matrix market dataset and the cluster vector datasets must be set for the parsing.
## NOTE:
The road_usa graph was too big for my computer to even parse it, even the .mat file couldn't be loaded inside matlab (the application was killed), so only the matrices that I could parse were used.
